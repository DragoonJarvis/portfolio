I am a Graphic Designer at Florida Southern College with over four years of experience in creating engaging and effective visual solutions for various projects. I have a strong background in graphic design, as well as 3D modeling and rendering skills that allow me to produce realistic or even stylized and immersive worlds and characters. I am proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, Blender, and other industry-standard software. I enjoy collaborating with other creative professionals and clients to deliver high-quality results that meet their needs and expectations. I also love gaming and working on expanding my skills. I am always eager to learn new techniques and tools to enhance my craft and expand my portfolio.
